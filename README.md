# Deep SORT and Kalman Filter
We did an implementation of Kalman Filter for my Computer Vision final project.
As a resource I used this video for the construction of my main.py function:

## Deep Sort
We were working with the oficial DeepSORT implementation, that you can address it [here](https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort).
## Data and questions.
The data for the implementation is here in the repository, and you can ask questions (or read the report) for the Kalman Filter implementation, the theory for the implementation was obtained from Statitical and Computational Inverse Problems -  Jari Kaipio.
